Tracts
======

Tracts is a set of classes and definitions used to model migration histories
based on ancestry tracts in admixed individuals. Time-dependent gene-flow from
multiple populations can be modeled.

Examples
========

Examples contains sample hapmap data and scripts to analyze them, including two
different gene flow models.  It also contains a 3-population model for 1000
genomes puerto Rican data

Installation
============

Copy all files and folders locally (See "Download zip" on the github repository
page), and run the following command

``python setup.py install``

<!-- "tracts.py" is a python module. All its functions can be used from the python
interpreter or ipython after it has been imported. It should work
out-of-the-box once you have python, and numpy, pylab, scipy installed. -->

If you are an academic, I recommend installing the Anaconda
(https://store.continuum.io/cshop/academicanaconda) distribution. Make sure not
to pay for it! Click Anaconda Academic License; it should be free for those
with edu e-mail addresses."

Input
=====

Tracts input is a set bed-style file describing the local ancestry of segments
along the genome.  The file has 2 extra columns for the cM positions of the
segments. There are two input files per individuals (for each haploid genome
copy).

    chrom       begin       end         assignment  cmBegin cmEnd
    chr13       0           18110261    UNKNOWN 0.0         0.19
    chr13       18110261    28539742    YRI         0.19        22.193
    chr13       28539742    28540421    UNKNOWN 22.193      22.193
    chr13       28540421    91255067    CEU     22.193      84.7013

Driver File
===========

To maintain maximum flexibility, the options and models in tracts are set up in
a driver file and a "model" file. Examples of both are provided in the
distribution; these examples are the best starting points for the first-time.
Tracts can be used interactively--when using the (i)python console, it is easy
to examine and plot the different variables.

Output
======

The 3-population exemple files produce 5 output files, e.g.

     boot0_-252.11_bins boot0_-252.11_liks  boot0_-252.11_ord   boot0_-252.11_pred
     boot0_-252.11_dat  boot0_-252.11_mig   boot0_-252.11_pars


boot0 means that this is bootstrap iteration 0, which in the convention used
here means the fit with the real data (in the two-population example, there is
no bootstrap, so the output is named "out" and "out2" instead) -252.11 is the
likelihood of the best-fit model

* _bins: the bins used in the discretization
* _dat: the observed counts in each bins
* _pred: the predicted counts in each bin, according to the model
* _mig: the inferred migration matrix, with the most recent generation at the
    top, and one column per migrant population
* _pars: the optimal parameters
* _liks: the likelihoods in the model parameter space in the output format of
    scipy.optimizes' "brute" function: the first number is the best likelihood,
    the top matrices define the grid of parameters usedin the search, and the
    last matrix defines the likelihood at all grid points. see

Setting up a demographic model
==============================

The space of possible incoming migration matrices is quite large; if we have
`p` migrant populations over `g` generations, there can be `n*g` different
migration rates. To simplify this, we introduce simplified parametrized models
that describe the full migration matrix in terms of a few parameters. These
models may, for example,  involve a discrete number of admixture pulses, or
periods of constant migrations rate. The user has full flexibility in defining
these models; in python, one needs to write a function that takes parameters as
an input (such as the time of the onset of migration, migration rate `p`), and
returns a migration matrix.

Here is the simplest example of such a function, implementing a single pulse of
migration:

    def pp((init_Eu,tstart)):
            """ A simple model in which populations Eu and AFR arrive
                discretely at first generation. If a time is not integer, the
                migration is divided between neighboring times proportional to
                the non-integer time fraction.  """

            # the time is scaled by a factor 100 in this model to ease
            # optimization with some routines that expect all parameters to
            # have the same scale
            tstart *= 100

            if  tstart < 0:
                    #time shouldn't be negative: that should be caught by
                    #constraint function (below). Return empty matrix
                    gen = int(numpy.ceil(max(tstart, 0))) + 1
                    mig = numpy.zeros((gen+1, 2))
                    return mig

            # number of generations in the migration matrix
            gen  = int(numpy.ceil(tstart)) + 1
            # how close we are to the integer approximation
            frac = gen - tstart - 1
            # placeholder migration matrix
            mig  = numpy.zeros((gen + 1, 2))

            #initial migration rates must sum up to one.
            initNat = 1 - init_Eu

            # Replace a fraction at second generation to ensure a continuous
            # model distribution with generation
            mig[-1,:] = numpy.array([init_Eu, initNat])
            mig[-2,:] = frac * numpy.array([init_Eu, initNat])

            return mig

Some parameter values are inconsistent: times must be positive, and proportions
of migrants must be between 0 and 1. We define an auxiliary function that
verifies whether these conditions are met It returns a number that is
nonnegative if constraints are satisfied, and gets increasingly negative when
they are more strongly violated.

    def outofbounds_pp(params):
            """ Constraint function evaluating below zero when constraints not
                satisfied. """
            ret = 1 #initialize the return variable to a positive value.
            (init_Eu, tstart) = params

            # migration proportion must be between 0 and 1
            ret = min(1, 1 - init_Eu)
            ret = min(ret, init_Eu)


            # generate the migration matrix and test for possible issues
            func = pp #specify the model
            mig = func(params) #get the migration matrix
            # calculate the migration rate per generation
            totmig = mig.sum(axis=1)

            # first generation migration must sum up to 1
            ret = min(ret, -abs(totmig[-1] - 1) + 1e-8)
            # no migrations are allowed in the first two generations
            ret = min(ret, -totmig[0], -totmig[1])

            # migration at any given generation cannot be greater than 1
            ret = min(ret, 10 * min(1 - totmig), 10 * min(totmig))

            # start time must be at least two generations ago
            ret = min(ret, tstart - .02)

            return ret


The population is founded when two populations meet; at the first generation,
we consider all individuals in the population as “migrants”, so the sum of
migration frequencies at the first generation must be one. If it isn’t,
tracts will complain.

Importantly, the optimizers in tracts assume that all parameters are
continuous, but the underlying markov model uses discrete generations.  When a
time falls between two integers, the migrants are distributed across the
neighboring integers, in such a way that the migration matrix changes
“continuously”, in the sense that expected number of migrants. Continuous
change is important, because likelihood optimizers can really struggle if the
model is discontinuous in parameter space.

FAQ
===

> The distribution of tract lengths decreases as a function of tract length,
> but increases at the very last bin. This was not seen in the original paper.
> What is going on?

In tracts, the last bin represents the number of chromosomes with no ancestry
switches. It does not correspond to a specific length value, and for this
reason was not plotted in the tracts paper.


> When I have a single pulse of admixture, I would expect an exponential
> distribution of tract length, but the distribution of tract lengths shows
> steps in the expected length. Why is that?

"Tracts" takes into account the finite length of chromosomes. Since ancestry
tracts cannot extend beyond chromosomes, we expect this departure from an
exponential distribution

> I have migrants from the last generation. "tracts" tells me that migrants in
> the last two generations are not allowed. Why is that?

Haploid genomes from the last two generations have no ancestry switches and
should be easy to identify in well-phased data--they should be removed from the
sample before running tracts. If this is impossible (e.g., because of
inaccurate phasing across chromosomes), tracts will likely attempt to assign
last-generation migrants to two generations ago. This should be observable by
an excess of very long tracts in the data compared to the model.

> Individuals in my population vary considerably in their ancestry proportion.
> Is that a problem?

It is not a problem as long as the population was close to random mating. If
admixture is recent, random mating is not inconsistent with ancestry variance.
If admixture is ancient, however, variation in ancestry proportion may indicate
population structure, and the random mating assumption may fail.

> I ran the optimization steps many times, and found different optimal
> likelihoods. Why is that?

Optimizing functions in many dimensions is hard, and sometimes optimizers get
stuck in local maxima. If you haven tried already, you can attempt to fix the
ancestry proportions a priori (see the `_fix` examples in the documentation).
In most cases, the optimization will converge to the global maximum a
substantial proportion of the time: running the optimization a few times from
random starting positions and comparing the best values may help control for
this.

If you fail to revisit the same minimum after running say, 10 optimizations,
then something else might be going on. If the model is not continuous as a
function of a parameter, it could make the optimization much harder. Defining a
continuous model would help, or you could try the brute-force optimization
method if the number of parameters is small.
