    Optimize params to fit model to data using the cobyla method.

    This optimization method works well when we start reasonably close to the
    optimum. It is best at burrowing down a single minimum.


    It should also perform better when parameters range over scales.

    p0: Initial parameters.
    data: Spectrum with data.
    model_function: Function to evaluate model spectrum. Should take arguments
                    (params, pts)
    out_of_bounds_fun: A funtion evaluating to True if the current parameters are in a forbidden region.
    cutoff: the number of bins to drop at the beginning of the array. This could be achieved with masks.

    verbose: If > 0, print optimization status every <verbose> steps.
    flush_delay: Standard output will be flushed once every <flush_delay>
                 minutes. This is useful to avoid overloading I/O on clusters.
    epsilon: Step-size to use for finite-difference derivatives.
    gtol: Convergence criterion for optimization. For more info,
          see help(scipy.optimize.fmin_bfgs)

    maxiter: Maximum iterations to run for.
    full_output: If True, return full outputs as in described in
                 help(scipy.optimize.fmin_bfgs)
    func_args: Additional arguments to model_func. It is assumed that
               model_func's first argument is an array of parameters to
               optimize, that its second argument is an array of sample sizes
               for the sfs, and that its last argument is the list of grid
               points to use in evaluation.
    fixed_params: If not None, should be a list used to fix model parameters at
                  particular values. For example, if the model parameters
                  are (nu1,nu2,T,m), then fixed_params = [0.5,None,None,2]
                  will hold nu1=0.5 and m=2. The optimizer will only change
                  T and m. Note that the bounds lists must include all
                  parameters. Optimization will fail if the fixed values
                  lie outside their bounds. A full-length p0 should be passed
                  in; values corresponding to fixed parameters are ignored.
    ll_scale: The bfgs algorithm may fail if your initial log-likelihood is
              too large. (This appears to be a flaw in the scipy
              implementation.) To overcome this, pass ll_scale > 1, which will
              simply reduce the magnitude of the log-likelihood. Once in a
              region of reasonable likelihood, you'll probably want to
              re-optimize with ll_scale=1.
